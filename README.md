# The Browsers Have Eyes

This demo uses the p5.js javascript library to make some interactive 3D eyes that look at the cursor.

The code could be refactored down for sure but this wasn't the goal. instead this was my first time using the 3D functionality of p5.js and as such I'd consider it more of a learning experince for things like how the jpg maps around the sphere to work as a texture.

This interactive demo is part of a larger project, part of which is to investigate using 2D vs 3D graphics.
